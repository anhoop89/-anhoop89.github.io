# .My personal porfolio
The website is my personal porfolio. It's avalaible at https://anhoop89.github.io/main.html
# .Tools
I've used mainly HTML, CSS, Javescript to build it up. 
# .How to run the website
It has only one html file to run all the sections in the porfolio. Bascially, all we need to open the file main.html on any web browsers. It should be popping up, then you could see my project. 
# .How I built the website
1. It has been built based on HTML, CSS, Javescript. This project has 4 folders including:
- CSS: navbar.css, slider.css, and style.css
- js: script.js
- img: images used for the site
- main.html stays alone without a folder. 
The reason I break them down into a few files because It helps me to reduce the numbers of line of code in each file. It's easier for me to maintain and fix my code when getting a bug. 
2. [***BOOSTRAP***](https://getbootstrap.com/) : I used their classes from this tool to build most of my section. It helps me a lot with styling. 

    - To use the library from boostrap, I need to link them into my main.html:

        ```html
          <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
          <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>

3. [***JQUERY***](https://jquery.com/): It's used to build navbar and check form in javascript. 
    - To use this library, I need to link them into my main.html:
        ```html
            <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js"></script>

4. [***FONT AWESOME***](https://fontawesome.com/): This library has lots of great icons.
    - To use this library, I need to link them into my main.html:
        ```html
         <script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/3a1096fe87.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

5.  [***AOS***](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/): This library offers some good animation. It helps trasition between sections/elements smoother.

      - To use this library, I need to link them into my main.html:

        ```html
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/aos@next/dist/aos.css" />
        <script src="https://unpkg.com/aos@next/dist/aos.js"></script>
        <script>
        AOS.init({
            offset: 100,
            duration: 500
        });
         </script>
        ```
 6. [***GOOGLE FONTS***](https://fonts.google.com/): I used this library to pick my favorite font family for my whole website. 
      - To use this library, I need to link them into my main.html:
         
         ```html
         <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
         <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
         <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Catamaran&family=Nanum+Gothic+Coding&display=swap"
          rel="stylesheet">
